<p class="bd-lead">Utilty classes available in the Template, in addition to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/">Utilities offered in Bootstrap 4</a></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">CSS utilities offer many classes available to do small little one-off things. Like classes to adjust margin or padding. Classes to set colors. Classes to set specific layout properties. Classes for sizing. Utility libraries may approach these things in different ways, but seem to share that idea. Which, in essence, brings styling to the HTML level rather than the CSS level.</blockquote>
